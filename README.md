*libdash* is a fork of the Linux Kernel's `dash` shell that builds a linkable library with extra exposed interfaces. The primary use of libdash is to parse shell scripts, but it could be used for more.

# How to use the parser

The ideal interface to use is `parsecmd_safe` in `parser.c`. Parsing the POSIX shell is a complicated affair: beyond the usual locale issues, aliases affect the lexer, so one must use `setalias` and `unalias` to manage any aliases that ought to exist.

# How work with the parsed nodes

The general AST is described in `nodes.h`. There are some tricky invariants around the precise formatting of control codes; the OCaml code shows some examples of working with the `args` fields.
